        <h1>Our Objective</h1>
        <p>The motivation behind our database is to solve our own problems we had in our day to day lives. Nutrition is something that can get really complicated at first sight but gets easy quickly with a bit of guidance. Hence, we wanted to create a database that makes nutrition easier for all. By providing recipes, ingredients, and macro and micronutrients we cover the bases of nutrition and then personalize it to suit everyoneâ€™s specific needs. In doing so, we are helping people figure out how to eat excellently and exactly in their own way. This gives everyone a chance to give their bodies the best fuel they want to get and not just need</p>        <br>
