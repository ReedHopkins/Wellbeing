		<h1>Our Objective</h1>
		<a href="https://github.com/WellBeingEating/Wellbeing">Github Link</a>
		<p>
			The motivation behind our database is to solve our own problems we had in our day to day lives. Nutrition is
			something that can get really complicated at first sight but gets easy quickly with a bit of guidance.
			Hence, we wanted to create a database that makes nutrition easier for all. By providing recipes,
			ingredients, and macro and micronutrients we cover the bases of nutrition and then personalize it to suit
			everyone’s specific needs. In doing so, we are helping people figure out how to eat excellently and exactly
			in their own way. This gives everyone a chance to give their bodies the best fuel they <i><b>want</b></i> to
			get and not just need

		<h1>Github Stats</h1>

		<div id="opensource-projects"></div>



		<br>
		<h1>Data</h1>
		<p><a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular API</a> - Used to get recipe information including
			calorie count, cooking time, etc</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api">Nutritionix API</a> - Used to get ingredient information
			including brand, calories, fat, sugar, and other nutrient information </p>
		<p>Web Scraping - There was no available API for food in conjunction with prices. Given this scenario, we had to
			scrape a site (in our case <a href="https://www.heb.com/browse/shop">HEB's</a> site), using Python and
			BeautifulSoup, and grab prices of food off of the webpage.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Tools</h1>
		<p>AWS: Our website is deployed using Amazon Web Services. Deploying on AWS involves uploading source code
			files. So, the process is easy and could be easily automated in the future.</p>
		<p>Sublime: Sublime is one of our IDEs of choice for the development of this website. It was used for writing
			HTML, CSS, and Python code.</p>
		<p>Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a great resource for premade css elements. We used bootstrap to design the website
			and pulled many elements from it such as the navigation bar and database</p>
